Encryption and Decryption of Caesar Cipher using Files  <br/>

he Caesar cipher, also known as a shift cipher, is one of the simplest forms of encryption. It is a substitution cipher where each letter in the original message (called the plaintext) is replaced with a letter corresponding to a certain number of letters up or down in the alphabet. <br/>

Algorithm for Caesar Cipher: <br/>

**Input:**  <br/>
Read content from a input file <br/>
A String of lower case letters, called Text. <br/>
An Integer between 0-25 denoting the required shift. <br/>
**Procedure:** <br/>
Traverse the given text one character at a time . <br/>
For each character, transform the given character as per the rule, depending on whether weâ€™re encrypting or decrypting the text. <br/>
Output the new string generated. <br/>
